Most of these tweaks implement a MissionControl concept for iOS. The concept merges the NotificationCenter and ControlCenter into a single component. While it was easy to keep the tweaks up to date for iOS 9, iOS 10 broke too many multitasking related things to update the tweaks. The tweaks a written in Objective-C++ and can be compiled using [theos](https://github.com/theos/theos).
