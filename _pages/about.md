Hi my Name is David. I have studied computer science at the Johannes Gutenberg University (JGU) in Mainz. In 2021 I completed my master in computer science with a focus on mathematics. Currently I'm a PhD student at the Programming Languages group at the JGU, under the leadership of Sebastian Erdweg.

Since I'm thirteen I spend some of my free time to develop stuff for all kinds of apple devices. Therefore I'm most familiar with the programming languages: Swift, Objective-C, C and Python. You can check out my portfolio to see some of the things I wrote.
